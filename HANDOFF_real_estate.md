# Handoff — Real Estate tab work (2026-05-23)

Context for a fresh Claude Code session picking up the Real Estate dashboard work.
Repo: `btabiado/btc-eth-etf-dashboard`. Live site: `https://btabiado.github.io/btc-eth-etf-dashboard/`.

## What shipped today (both MERGED to `main`, deployed live)

1. **PR #14 — Fort Myers / principal-city alias search fix** (squash `60c15c8`)
   - Problem: searching "Fort Myers" returned nothing — the metro is filed under
     its Zillow short name "Cape Coral, FL", and search greps `name + short_name + state`.
     The full Census MSA "Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FL" (which embeds the alias) was only
     written for ~50 of 894 metros.
   - Fix: `scripts/fetch_real_estate.py` now resolves each metro's `name` via the
     Census Bureau CBSA gazetteer, **delegating to `scripts/fetch_metro_coords.py`**
     helpers (`fetch_gazetteer_txt` / `parse_gazetteer` / `index_gazetteer` /
     `match_metro`) instead of duplicating that logic. `METRO_LONG_NAME_OVERRIDES`
     kept as a ~110-entry fallback for when the gazetteer fetch is unavailable.
   - Also patched the committed `data/real_estate.json` in-place so 55 metros got
     expanded names immediately (Fort Myers, Sarasota, Daytona, Melbourne, Stamford,
     Springdale, College Station, Council Bluffs, Edinburg, Paso Robles, ...).
   - Sibling import note: works because the daily workflow runs
     `python scripts/fetch_real_estate.py` directly (puts `scripts/` on `sys.path`).

2. **PR #15 — Mobile Real Estate landing redesign** (squash `390c64f`)
   - Replaced the 5-static-KPI strip in the `tab-real_estate` view (`app.py`).
   - New layout (function `_drawRealEstate`, ~line 4739 in `app.py`):
     - **National Housing Heat Index** hero: 0–100 composite (% above list, DOM,
       % price cuts, YoY ZHVI), gradient gauge + needle, 30d/1y delta chips.
       Labels: Cold 0–25, Cool 26–45, Warm 46–65, Hot 66–85, Scorching 86–100.
     - **🔥 Hot Markets** carousel — top 10 by `pct_above_list`, swipeable.
     - **❄️ Cooling Markets** carousel — top 10 by `pct_price_cut`.
     - Compressed 3-card KPI row (Median ZHVI / +YoY metros / Avg DOM).
     - Inline SVG sparklines (no Chart.js dep). `esc()` used on metro strings.

## Data state

- `data/real_estate.json`: 894 metros, snapshot `2026-05-23T11:16:10Z`.
- KPI coverage: ZHVI/new_listings/active_listings/pct_price_cut = 100%; DOM 98%;
  pct_above_list 98%; sale_to_list 93%; median_sale 84%; **homes_sold 33%**;
  permits 0% (national-only by design).
- After the in-place patch: **99 of 894** metros have Census-expanded names; the
  other **795 are still on bare Zillow short form**.

## Happens automatically (no action needed)

- **Daily refresh ~06:00 UTC** (`.github/workflows/real-estate-daily.yml`) re-runs the
  new fetcher and should expand all ~390 US MSAs to full Census names.
- **Verify after that runs:** Census-named metro count should jump from 99 → ~390.
  Quick check: count metros where `name != f"{short_name}, {state}"`.

## OPEN ITEMS / pending user decisions

1. **"St Pete" (no period) search miss.** Search is literal substring; data has
   "St. Petersburg" with a period, so `St Pete` / `Ft Worth` / `Mt Vernon` (no period)
   miss. Proposed fix: normalize (strip periods, collapse whitespace) on BOTH query
   and haystack in `real_estate/index.html` `metroMatchesSearch()` (~line 327) and the
   main dashboard search. ~10 lines. **NOT yet done.**

2. **Tampa / St. Petersburg / Clearwater "separation."** User wants these to feel
   separate. Constraint: they're ONE Census MSA (CBSA 45300); Zillow + Redfin report
   KPIs only at MSA level — no separate per-city stats exist. Options discussed:
   (a) search-only fix so all aliases find the MSA [recommended];
   (b) fake alias rows showing identical data [misleading];
   (c) pull Zillow city-level ZHVI CSVs for real per-city home values, but other KPIs
   stay MSA-level [partial-data inconsistency]. **User dismissed the question — awaiting
   direction. Do NOT build until they choose.**

3. **AUDIT FINDING — heat-index `homes_sold` gate.** The `MIN_SALES = 100` gate
   (`homes_sold >= 100`) filters the heat index + both carousels to **296 of 894**
   metros. But 593 of the excluded metros HAVE valid `pct_above_list` data — they're
   dropped because `homes_sold` is only 33%-populated (a Redfin coverage gap), not
   because they're genuinely small. Index reads **48 with gate vs 42 without** — a
   6-pt swing from a data-coverage artifact. **Suggested fix:** keep the gate on the
   *carousels* (avoids one freak low-volume market topping the list), but compute the
   *index* over all metros, OR switch the liquidity proxy to `active_listings`
   (100%-populated). **NOT yet done — awaiting user go-ahead.**

4. **Enhancement (not a bug):** carousel cards are static; tapping does nothing.
   Could deep-link to `/real-estate/` for that metro.

## Key files

- `app.py` — main dashboard. Real Estate tab HTML ~line 2114; `_drawRealEstate` ~4739.
- `real_estate/index.html` — standalone `/real-estate/` full page; search ~line 327.
- `scripts/fetch_real_estate.py` — builds `data/real_estate.json` (daily).
- `scripts/fetch_metro_coords.py` — Census CBSA gazetteer helpers (reused by the above).
- `.github/workflows/real-estate-daily.yml` — daily data refresh.
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` — builds + deploys the site on push to main + hourly.

## Branch / workflow notes

- Designated dev branch this session was `claude/mobile-realestate-landing-page-AXKuQ`
  (now merged). New work should branch from `main`.
- Sandbox network policy blocks `www2.census.gov`, `files.zillowstatic.com`, and
  `btabiado.github.io` — you can't run the live fetcher or load the site from the
  sandbox. CI/GitHub Actions has full network access; rely on it for data refresh.
- GitHub access is via `mcp__github__*` MCP tools only (no `gh` CLI). Repo scope is
  restricted to `btabiado/btc-eth-etf-dashboard`.
