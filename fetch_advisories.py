"""
U.S. State Department travel-advisory fetcher.

Sources (all free, no auth required):
  travel.state.gov HTML  per-country advisory level, risk codes, date
  travel.state.gov RSS   security alerts / advisory-update bulletins

Output: v2/data-travel.json (sidecar for the V2 dashboard's Travel Advisories tab).

Schema (matches what the front-end consumes):
    {
      "generated_at": "2026-05-25T12:00:00Z",
      "advisories": [
        {"name": "Afghanistan", "level": 4, "risks": ["U","C","H","K","T","D","N"],
         "date": "2026-02-20",
         "url": "https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/travel-advisories/afghanistan.html"}
      ],
      "bulletins": [
        {"tag": "Worldwide Caution", "severity": "red", "date": "2026-03-22",
         "title": "...", "body": "...", "href": "https://..."}
      ]
    }

Cadence: SAFE to run hourly alongside the other fetchers (State Dept data
moves on a scale of days to weeks), but ideally this would be daily-gated by
whoever wires up CI — there's no benefit to scraping the HTML page 24 times
a day. We do NOT enforce that here; leaving the cadence decision to the
caller keeps this module a pure pipeline step.

Resilience: on any scrape failure (or zero-advisory result) we read the
existing v2/data-travel.json, log a warning, and exit non-zero WITHOUT
overwriting it. The dashboard never sees an empty advisories list.

CLI:
    python fetch_advisories.py                 # default --out v2/data-travel.json
    python fetch_advisories.py --out PATH      # custom output path
    python fetch_advisories.py --no-network    # offline parser self-test only

#       always describe a specific change (embassy ops, new threat, etc.).

# dropped UNLESS the change was a meaningful level decrease (e.g. Vanuatu
